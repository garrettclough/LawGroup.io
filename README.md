# LawGroup.io

Website for a law group built using Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS3, & Javascript.

Webiste - www.LawGroup.io [Deployed with Netlify]

## Lessons Learned
This was my first live project after completing a web development course. I used Bootstrap for this project and found it best to keep things simple. This project is front-end focused and is not a full stack project.
